  <h1>The Purposes of Rocket Jumping</h1>
  <p>Soldier's mobility skyrockets once the player finds out they can hit themself. With this newfound mobility, Soldier goes from an okay combat class to an absolutely stellar one. In the 6s competitive format, each team is expected to have two Soldiers to allow for one Soldier to stay with the team while the other Soldier goes for meaningful plays that no other class can really do because they can't rocket jump. Beyond simply looking cool, Soldier mains will rocket jump for a variety of purposes.</p>
    <ul class="notNav">
      <li class="notNav">Get to higher places. This gives Soldier a higher vantage point, giving him and his team a big advantage because of how much information he can call from higher ground. Additionally, being positioned on high ground gives Soldier a big advantage in fights because if he misses, then he can still deal damage and make space from the splash damage after the rocket hits the ground.  </li>
      <li class="notNav">Get to places faster. Rocket jumping preserves all momentum, so when you continuously rocket jump, you can get to any location on the map in a very short amount of time. This is especially crucial during the start of the round, where Soldier can rocket jump from spawn to the fighting area in a few seconds, often being the first to get to the fight. The winner of this battle for the first point is often decided by which team's Soldiers got there first, because of the Soldier's good damage and ability to make space with knockback. In 6s, the winner of the first fight generally takes the rest of the round too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSibjWkYuqo">This</a> is an example of a good rollout (how a class gets from spawn to the first fight), and connects to the next point. </li>
      <li class="notNav">Get the jump on enemies and take them down quickly, as was seen in the previous clip. Typical 6s matches on Process (the map in the video) have the Soldier on one of the crates in the middle, because it gives them high ground to shoot from and call out enemy positions. However, this Soldier's rollout was fast enough to meet the enemy team just as they are about to enter the midpoint, letting the Soldier take down the Medic because the enemy team is unprepared to face him so early. This forces the enemy team to have to fight mid without healing, which is extremely disadvantageous since now they can't just retreat to the Medic when their health gets too low. In this situation, many teams will just retreat to defend second point if their Medic dies too early, because while retreating to second could potentially allow them to hold the enemy off long enough for their Medic to return or even let them push back to mid, staying at mid without a Medic will almost certainly lead to a team wipe, making them lose mid and likely second too, since the team is too dead to protect the second point. </li>
      <li class="notNav">To chase down retreating enemies. Soldiers will rocket jump towards an enemy with low health to finish them off, because the Soldier's rockets deal more damage the closer the Soldier is to the target. </li>
      <li class="notNav"><img src="images/431d37493dac36975805bcdf3659ff11.gif" alt="Trolldier in action">Use the Market Gardener. The Market Gardener is an unlockable melee weapon that deals guaranteed critical hits (3x damage) on players it hits if the Soldier is airborne from a explosive jump (the crit will proc if the Soldier is airborne from other explosives as well). Soldiers playing in Competitive, typically the Roamer (the one playing more offensively) will sometimes use the Market Gardener to get high priority picks, such as Medics and Snipers, because the instant 195 damage will one-shot a majority of the game's classes, with the two classes it can't (Heavy and Soldier, who also likely will die soon after because being market gardened at full health will leave him at 5 HP) being lower priority. Of course, this locks them out of the Escape Plan, a melee weapon that increases the Soldier's move speed at low health when equipped as well as the most popular choice of melee weapon in higher play, but for Soldiers more confident in their rocket jumping than their shooting, it can be very useful. Some players will dedicate their entire playstyle around this, by equipping the Rocket Jumper (unlockable primary weapon that deals no damage at all to anyone, leading to risk-free rocket jumps), a secondary of choice (commonly the Mantreads for increased strafing control), and the Market Gardener, and are commonly dubbed as Trolldiers by the community. This playstyle tends to be impractical, because it completely disables Soldier's main means of dealing damage for a killing method that is rendered useless if the would-be victim knows they should walk forward rather than back. However, this means that players will be especially frustrated when they are killed by a Trolldier, because it's essentially an insult to their skill when they die by this joke playstyle, hence the name "Trolldier." </li>
      <ul class="notNav">
        <li class="notNav">The gif above is a demonstration of the Trolldier playtyle. Notice how the Trolldier has to do a small rocket jump before every attempt at a Market Garden, which is what causes him to lose against the other Soldier. At times, this Trolldier also makes use of the bunny hopping exploit, which allows a Soldier to register as still in the air if he jumps within a very small frame window right after touching the ground. This allows him to get some sneakier Market Gardens.</li>
