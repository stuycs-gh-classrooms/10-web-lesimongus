  <h1>The Purposes of Rocket Jumping</h2>
  <p>
    Now that we have established how to do this, we now have to go over what this can be used for. Rocket jumping is a fun movement technique that allows the second slowest class in the game to reach incredible speeds and heights that no other class can get to. In higher play, rocket jumping becomes an integral part of Soldier, being so impactful that in the 6v6 competitive format there are two Soldiers in each team, one Pocket Soldier who mostly sticks with the Medic and the rest of the combo, and one Roamer, who plays more offensively and will often rocket jump to take out an important enemy player, often the Medic. The main reasons players rocket jump are to:
<ul>
<li>Get to higher places, allowing the Soldier to see from a better vantage point as well as fight better due to being on the high ground. </li>
<li>Get to places faster. Rocket jumping preserves all momentum, so when you chain Rocket Jumps together, you can get to locations extremely fast. </li>
<li>On a similar note to the previous point, this allows Soldier to go from Spawn to the main fighting area extremely fast. Soldiers will often be one of the first to get to the fight, which is crucial as they are great at dealing damage and making space. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSibjWkYuqo">This</a> is an example of a good rollout, and connects to the next point. </li>
<li>Get the jump on enemies and take them down quickly, or chase them down. What you saw in the previous clip was an example of the former. In normal 6s matches on Process (the map in the video), the Soldier is generally on one of the crates in the middle, which gives them high ground to shoot from and call out enemy positions. However, the Soldier in the video altered the rollout to go fast enough to meet the enemy team as they are just about to enter the midpoint. This is way farther than where the Soldier generally should be, which catches the enemy team off guard and allows the Soldier to take down the Medic, leaving the enemy team to have to fight mid without healing, which is extremely disadvantage and many teams will often just retreat to defend second point if their Medic dies too early. In the latter case, Soldiers will rocket jump towards a finishing enemy to finish them off, as the Soldier's rockets deal more damage the closer the Soldier is to the target. </li>
<li>Use the Market Gardener on enemies. The Market Gardener is an unlockable melee weapon that deals guaranteed critical hits (3x damage) on players it hits, on the condition that the Soldier has to be airborne from a rocket jump to do so. Some players will dedicate their entire playstyle around this, and are commonly dubbed as Trolldiers by the community, because although the playstyle tends to be impractical, players will be very annoyed if they actually do get taken down by a Trolldier. </li>
</ul>
