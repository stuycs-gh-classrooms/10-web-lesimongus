  <h1>The Purposes of Rocket Jumping</h2>
  <p>Alright, so Soldier's mobility skyrockets once the player finds out they can hit themself. With this newfound mobility, Soldier goes from an okay combat class to an absolutely stellar one. In the 6s competitive format, each team is expected to have two Soldiers to allow for one Soldier to stay with the team while the other Soldier goes for meaningful plays that no other class can really do because they can't rocket jump. Beyond simply looking cool, Soldier mains will rocket jump for a variety of purposes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get to higher places, allowing the Soldier to see from a better vantage point as well as fight better due to being on the high ground. </li>
      <li>Get to places faster. Rocket jumping preserves all momentum, so when you chain Rocket Jumps together, you can get to locations extremely fast. </li>
      <li>On a similar note to the previous point, this allows Soldier to go from Spawn to the main fighting area extremely fast. Soldiers will often be one of the first to get to the fight, which is crucial as they are great at dealing damage and making space. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSibjWkYuqo">This</a> is an example of a good rollout, and connects to the next point. </li>
      <li>Get the jump on enemies and take them down quickly, or chase them down. What you saw in the previous clip was an example of the former. In normal 6s matches on Process (the map in the video), the Soldier is generally on one of the crates in the middle, which gives them high ground to shoot from and call out enemy positions. However, the Soldier in the video altered the rollout to go fast enough to meet the enemy team as they are just about to enter the midpoint. This is way farther than where the Soldier generally should be, which catches the enemy team off guard and allows the Soldier to take down the Medic, leaving the enemy team to have to fight mid without healing, which is extremely disadvantage and many teams will often just retreat to defend second point if their Medic dies too early. In the latter case, Soldiers will rocket jump towards a finishing enemy to finish them off, as the Soldier's rockets deal more damage the closer the Soldier is to the target. </li>
      <li>Use the Market Gardener on enemies. The Market Gardener is an unlockable melee weapon that deals guaranteed critical hits (3x damage) on players it hits, on the condition that the Soldier has to be airborne from a rocket jump to do so. You will sometimes see Soldiers playing in Competitive use the Market Gardener to get high priority picks, like Medics and Snipers. Some players will dedicate their entire playstyle around this, and are commonly dubbed as Trolldiers by the community, because although the playstyle tends to be impractical, players will be very annoyed if they actually do get taken down by a Trolldier. </li>
    </ul>
