  <h1>Why It's So Cool</h1>
  <p>So, the character gets a nice movement technique, what of it? There are plenty of games that contain fun movement mechanics. Soldier isn't the only one who can rocket jump either; Demoman's stickies have a similar effect if he tries the same procedure. However, rocket jumping stands out among the sea of cool movement mechanics in video games for a variety of reasons. </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Despite being a bit more simple when compared to other forms of movement in other games, rocket jumping can lead to a plethora of different interactions. Where you shoot matters, and what situation you're in can drastically change what you should do. The player can shoot straight down to gain a lot of vertical height, shoot off of a wall or away from them for better speed, or jump off a wall midair for more time in the air. This is what separates rocket jumping from sticky jumping, as Demoman can only really benefit from two stickies before he takes himself out, when even one sticky can get him low enough that he shouldn't engage in the fight. </li>
     <li>It's risky. The rockets can take large chunks off of the Soldier's health, and it's common to see some players get very close to a Soldier that they're fighting to make them take recoil damage. With rocket jumping, this makes each jump count, causes the Soldier to think about when they should jump, and ultimately makes the moments where they succeed that much more thrilling and satisfying. Even the Gunboats, which lets you take less self-damage has a risk, as it causes you to lose out on the benefits on another weapon in your secondary slot. </li>
     <li>It can define a lot of match-ups. A Soldier that isn't good at rocket jumping is significantly worse than a Soldier that can rocket jump but is otherwise at a similar skill level, since they simply can't close the gap between faster classes like Scout or get the jump on vital classes like Demoman, Medic, and Sniper. The aforementioned Gunboats also causes you to play more carefully around Pyros, because their ability to deflect your rockets is much more impactful when you can't switch to a shotgun, which they can't deflect. </li>
     <li>It's just fun. Though it is a steep learning curve, with new players often looking like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h75Qglx6e-0">this</a> when they try it, once you get it down, it's very satisfying to zoom across the map at light speed to send a particularly annoying Sniper to the shadow realm with a shovel, to suddenly appear when your enemy wasn't expecting it and take out their med, or to just jump around the map. A bunch of other players share this sentiment, and there are entire community servers dedicated to help players get better at rocket jumping or to test how fast a skilled rocket jumper can clear a course. </li>
