  <h1>HOW TO ROCKET JUMP</h1>
  <p>
    At first glance, TF2's Soldier class is nothing special. Though his rocket launcher deals a decent amount of damage and knockback, the projectile is a bit slow and certain classes can either delete the projectile from existence or deflect it back at the Soldier. Fighting at close range is also a risk for the Soldier, as the rocket explosions can actually deal self-damage, albeit less damage than it would have dealt to enemies, meaning it's entirely possible for the Soldier to kill himself while fighting.

      <li>Look at any nearby surface like a wall or the ground, somewhere that would catch the player in the explosion if a rocket is shot there. Do note that where you shoot the rocket will affect your trajectory and speed.</li>
      <li>Crouch, jump, and shoot all at once. Or in other words, press left ctrl (many players rebind crouch to shift), space, and mouse1 at the same time. Though crouching is optional, it will let you get much higher heights.</li>
      <li>If all has been done correctly, you should now be hurtling through the air at high speeds. What you do now that you are airborne is up to you, whether it's to rocket jump again off a wall or shoot your rockets at the enemy.</li>
