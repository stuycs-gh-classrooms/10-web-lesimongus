  <h2>How to Rocket Jump</h2>
  <p>
    In Team Fortress 2, the Soldier's primary weapon is a Rocket Launcher, which shoots a projectile that deals good damage, has splash, and will cause knockback.
    As one might expect from an explosive weapon, this projectile will deal splash damage to the player, albeit much less damage than what an enemy would have taken, if the player is too close to what it hits.
    This is where the fun begins, however, as intentionally hitting oneself with the rocket's explosion and adding a few steps opens the way for the most fun feature in the game: Rocket Jumping
    Rocket Jumping, at its basics, is fairly simple.
    <ul>
      <li>Look at the ground, somewhere that would catch the player in the explosion if a rocket is shot there. Do note that where you shoot the rocket will affect your trajectory and speed.</li>
      <li>Crouch, jump, and shoot all at once. Or in other words, press left ctrl (many players rebind crouch to shift), space, and mouse1 at the same time. Though crouching is optional, it will let you get much higher heights.</li>
    </ul>
