  <h2>How to Rocket Jump</h2>
  <p>
    In Team Fortress 2, the Soldier's primary weapon is a Rocket Launcher, which shoots a projectile that deals good damage, has splash, and will cause knockback.
    As one might expect from an explosive weapon, this projectile will deal splash damage to the player, albeit much less damage than what an enemy would have taken, if the player is too close to what it hits.
    This is where the fun begins, however, as intentionally hitting oneself with the rocket's explosion and adding a few steps opens the way for the most fun feature in the game: Rocket Jumping.
    Rocket Jumping, at its basics, is fairly simple.
    <ul>
      <li>Look at any nearby surface like a wall or the ground, somewhere that would catch the player in the explosion if a rocket is shot there. Do note that where you shoot the rocket will affect your trajectory and speed.</li>
      <li>Crouch, jump, and shoot all at once. Or in other words, press left ctrl (many players rebind crouch to shift), space, and mouse1 at the same time. Though crouching is optional, it will let you get much higher heights.</li>
      <li>If all has been done correctly, you should now be hurtling through the air at high speeds. What you do now that you are airborne is up to you, whether it's to rocket jump again off a wall or shoot your rockets at the enemy.</li>

  <h2>The Purposes of Rocket Jumping</h2>
  <p>
    Now that we have established how to do this, we now have to go over what this can be used for. Rocket jumping is a fun movement technique that allows the second slowest class in the game to reach incredible speeds and heights that no other class can get to. In higher play, rocket jumping becomes an integral part of Soldier, being so impactful that in the 6v6 competitive format there are two Soldiers in each time, one Pocket Soldier who mostly sticks with the Medic and the rest of the combo, and the Roamer, who plays more offensively and will often rocket jump to take out an important enemy player, often the medic.
